I used to be divinity /
I used to be a god in my mind /
Sailing in an Odyssey /
I didn't know I was blind /
And when every time I set a course into the dark night /
You would follow me silently with searchlights /
I was only in my mind /
You were on the outside waiting /
I could feel you all the time /
Your voice could save me /
